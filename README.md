    Measure overall user satisfaction and engagement across recipes based on ratings and interaction metrics.
    Identify patterns in user feedback, such as frequent modifications or recurring issues, that apply to multiple dishes.
    Assess the diversity and distribution of recipes using identifiers like recipe_number and recipe_code.
    Offer recommendations for enhancing recipe presentation or addressing user concerns based on the data. italicized text
